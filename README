XCAP-Client 
-----------

XCAP (RFC 4825) is a protocol on top of HTTP which allows a client to manipu    late the contents of Presence Information Data Format (PIDF) based presence     documents. These documents are stored in a server in XML format and are fetc    hed, modified, replaced or deleted by the client. The protocol allows multip    le clients to manipulate the data, provided that they are authorized to do s    o. XCAP is already used in SIMPLE-based presence systems for manipulation of     presence lists and presence authorization policies.
 
XCAPClient library implements the XCAP protocol in client side, allowing the     applications to get, store, modify and delete XML documents in the server.
